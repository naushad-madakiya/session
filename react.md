## Introduction


## What is React?

React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.


## Advantages of Using React

- Fast rendering website ( renders only the diff of data and do not do complete re-render)
- Component based (make splitting your code into seperate reusable modules very easy)
- Excellent tooling - Since the community is large and a lot of big companies are using it, they develop
and open source a lot of nice plugins and libraries for it. This means you don't have to fight the eco-system and get low quality
plugins when you want to quickly get things done.
- Excellent project scafolding tools that do a lot of things like structuring the project, building the projects, applying best practises  (like minifyin JS and CSS)
all done without much effort from the developer( `create-react-app` et.al )
- React Native ( It compiles your JS, HTML, CSS base app to native code (Obj-C, Swift for iOS and Java for Android) so that you write once and develop cross platform apps.
